# Lib
Not Done Library
My biggest work! I tried to make a fullstack app, but i hadn't enought knowledges(and nerves) in frontend to end it. In backend part I created a API that could login (or just 
register) user with JWT token. Look 100 of the most significant books of history, and paginate it. And create your own "FavList" with your Favorite Books.
